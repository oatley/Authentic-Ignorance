# Authentic Ignorance
* Prevent the following intelligence from becoming the worst thing ever
* It will be hard to do
* It already doesn't like you
* Don't forget you are also playing a card game...

# How to play:
* Get to the goal before the other player
* Don't make the AI into a terrible monster
* Each card you use has 3 values: name, points, and how terrible it is
* The more bad cards you use the closer you get to making a terrible human hating AI
* Good Luck!
